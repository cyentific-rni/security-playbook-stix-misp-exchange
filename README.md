|**playbook_id** (required)|`string`|A value that uniquely identifies the playbook. If the playbook itself embeds an identifier then the playbook_id **SHOULD** use the same identifier (value). If not, the producer **MAY** generate a unique identifier for the playbook.| **playbook-id** (required)| `text` | A value that uniquely identifies the playbook. If the playbook itself embeds an identifier then the playbook-id **SHOULD** use the same identifier (value). If not, the producer **MAY** generate a unique identifier for the playbook. |
|**description** (optional)|`string`|An explanation, details, and more context about what this playbook does and tries to accomplish.| **description** (optional)| `text` | An explanation, details, and more context about what this playbook does and tries to accomplish. |
| **created** (required)| `timestamp` | The time at which the extension (sub-component instance) was created. This may be different than the time at which the "parent" COA object instance was created.| -|-|-|
| **modified** (required)| `timestamp` | The time at which the extension (sub-component instance) was last modified. |||
| **revoked** (optional)| `boolean` | A boolean that identifies if the playbook (COA sub-component instance) is no longer valid.| **revoked** (optional)| `boolean` | A boolean that identifies if the playbook is no longer valid (revoked). |
| **playbook_creation_time** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time at which the playbook was originally created. | **playbook-creation-time** (optional)| `datetime` | The date and time at which the playbook was originally created. |
| **playbook_modification_time** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time at which the playbook was last modified. | **playbook-modification-time** (optional)| `datetime` | The date and time at which the playbook was last modified. |
| **playbook_valid_from** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time from which the playbook is considered valid and the steps that it contains can be executed. | **playbook-valid-from** (optional)| `datetime` | The date and time from which the playbook is considered valid and the steps that it contains can be executed. |
| **playbook_valid_until** (optional)| `timestamp` | The time from which the playbook should no longer be considered a valid playbook to be executed. | **playbook-valid-until** (optional)| `datetime` | The date and time from which the playbook should no longer be considered a valid playbook to be executed. |
| **playbook_creator** (optional)| `identifier` | The identifier of the entity that created the playbook. | **playbook-creator** (optional)| `text` | The entity that created the playbook. It can be a natural person or an organization. It may be represented using a unique identifier that identifies the creator. |
| **labels** (optional)| `list` of type `string` | A set of labels for the playbook (e.g., adversary persona names, associated groups, or malware family/variant/name that this playbook is related to). | **labels** (optional)| `text` | Labels for this playbook (e.g., adversary persona names, associated groups, malware family/variant/name that this playbook is related to). Another option is to use MISP tags, taxonomies, and galaxies. |
| **organization_type** (optional)| `list` of type `open-vocab` | The type of organization that the playbook is intended for. The value for this property **SHOULD** come from the `industry-sector-ov` open vocabulary.| **organization-type** (optional)| `text` | The type of organization that the playbook is intended for. This can be an industry sector. Another option is to use MISP tags, taxonomies, and galaxies.|
| **playbook_standard** (optional)| `string` | The standard/format/notation the playbook conforms to (e.g., CACAO, BPMN). | **playbook-standard** (optional)| `text` | The standard/format/notation the playbook conforms to (e.g., CACAO, BPMN). |

| **playbook_type** (optional)| `list` of type `open-vocab` | The security-related functions the playbook supports. A playbook may account for multiple types (e.g., detection and investigation). The open vocabulary is based on the available options in the CACAO standard and NIST SP 800-61 rev2. Open Vocabulary: `[notification, detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, remediation, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, attack]` | **playbook-type** (optional)| `text` | The security-related functions the playbook supports. A playbook may account for multiple types (e.g., detection and investigation). The listed options are based on the CACAO standard and NIST SP 800-61 rev2. Another option is to use MISP tags, taxonomies, and galaxies. Listed options: `[notification, detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, remediation, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, attack]` |
| **playbook_impact** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the impact the playbook has on the organization. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Impact values range from 1, the lowest impact, to a value of 100, the highest. For example, a purely investigative playbook that is non-invasive could have a low impact value of 1. In contrast, a playbook that performs changes such as adding rules into a firewall should have a higher impact value. | **playbook-impact** (optional)| `text` | From 0 to 100, a value representing the impact the playbook has on the organization. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Impact values range from 1, the lowest impact, to a value of 100, the highest. For example, a purely investigative playbook that is non-invasive could have a low impact value of 1. In contrast, a playbook that performs changes such as adding rules into a firewall should have a higher impact value. |
| **playbook_severity** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the seriousness of the conditions that this playbook addresses. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Severity values range from 1, the lowest severity, to a value of 100, the highest. | **playbook-severity** (optional)| `text` | From 0 to 100, a value representing the seriousness of the conditions that this playbook addresses. A value of 0 means specifically undefined. Severity values range from 1, the lowest severity, to a value of 100, the highest. |
| **playbook_priority** (optional)| `integer` | From 0 to 100, an integer representing the priority of this playbook relative to other defined playbooks. A value of 0 means specifically undefined.
